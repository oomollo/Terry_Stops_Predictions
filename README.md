## Terry Traffic Stops Prediction for Supreme Court 

## Overview
The project Terry Stop Arrest Prediction leverages machine learning to uncover patterns in police stop data and provide actionable insights into arrest outcomes. It is designed to support law enforcement agencies in identifying key factors influencing arrest decisions and promoting fairness, accountability, and transparency in policing practices.

## Business Problem
Increased public concern over fairness and accountability in policing has put pressure on law enforcement agencies to better understand the factors influencing arrest decisions—especially during discretionary encounters like Terry Stops. Without clear, data-driven insight into what drives these outcomes, agencies risk perpetuating bias, losing public trust, and facing legal and reputational consequences.

This project aims to analyze historical Terry Stop data to uncover patterns associated with arrests. By identifying key predictive factors and assessing the role of sensitive attributes like race and gender, we can offer actionable recommendations to support equitable and transparent policing practices.

Key Business Questions:

• Are certain age groups more likely to be arrested during a Terry Stop?
• Does the subject’s perceived race or gender influence the likelihood of an arrest or frisk?
• How do arrest and frisk rates vary across different subject age groups?
• Do officer demographics (e.g., gender, race, age) influence arrest outcomes?
• Are there patterns in arrest decisions linked to specific officers or squads?
• Are subjects more likely to be frisked or arrested when certain weapon types are involved?
• Are certain precincts, sectors, or beats more prone to arrests or frisks?
